This page is mainly to be used as a learning resource for beginners learning japanese. There are three main features to this web application.

# 1.The Japanese Character Charts
-  These serve as a reference that the user can use in order to check what hiragana and katakana correspond to which english romaji
# 2. The flash cards
- This system allows the user to categorize japanese vocab and allows the user to add them to a collection to be able to review the translated meanings. Should be used after the user has mastered all hiragana and katakana

# 3. The Testing
- This system allows the user to test their knowledge on the Hiragana and Katakana. Since learning Hiragana and Katakana is done by line, the user is allowed to select which lines they would like to test themselve on. They have two options taking a multiple choice style quiz, or using their keyboard to input the english romaji as an answer
- Once the user is finished they receive a breakdown of their answers and how they did.

# About me: 
- I have been learning japanese for about a year now, and the basis for this project was really what kind of tool I would want to support me in learning the language when I started. This was my challenge to myself to do so.

# Potential Future Works
- Add user auth in order to allow people to have their own sets of flash cards
- Allow people to use their flashcards in the tests in addition to the hiragana and katakana
- Make flashcards more modular, perhaps letting users drag and drop them into certain places
